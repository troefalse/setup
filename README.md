# setup
Customizations saved here for whenever I reinstall. 



# Sidenote

Most path names probably requires renaming before use. 



# cmd - commands 
Holds new commands. 
Create files of format <commandName>.bat. 
These should be placed anywhere in PATH. 

# cmd - extensions 
Holds extension enablers. 

E.g. open cmd window with cl enabled, for compiling C files (assumes already installed).
